# Binary Search in Java

This is a basic implementation of the Binary Search algorithm in Java. Binary Search is an efficient search algorithm that works on a sorted array by repeatedly dividing the search range in half.

## Usage

1. Open the project in your preferred Java development environment.

2. Modify the main method in the BinarySearch class to use your own sorted array of numbers and target value.

3. Run the program.
